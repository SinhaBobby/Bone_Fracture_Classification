# Bone_Fracture_Classification
To predict the type of fracture through x-ray images. Training    data was less thus applied techniques like Data augmentation.  Attained accuracy of 83% through ResNet 9 architecture with techniques like one cycle LR, weight decay and Gradient Clipping. (In Progress)
